The .datetime file stores datetime information for files.
One file per line (we assume filenames don't embed newlines).
Each line is tab-separated, of the form:
last access time \t last data modification \t TAB last status change \t path

Times are in UTC.

It was generated with this command ("gstat is for MacOS after using
"brew install coreutils"; on Linux it's just "stat"):

TZ=UTC find . -type f -exec gstat --format $'%x\t%y\t%z\t%n' {} \; > .datetime
