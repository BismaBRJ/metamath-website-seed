How to set up a mirror site for the metamath.org web site
---------------------------------------------------------

If you want to mirror this site publicly, you may want to consider doing
so under a metamath.org subdomain.  These instructions show you how to
do this.


1. Get a subdomain name from me
-------------------------------

First you should provide me (Norm Megill, nm at alum dot mit dot edu)
with the IP address or domain name of your server.  I will then provide
you with a subdomain name (nl.metamath.org in this example).


2. Set up your Apache web server
--------------------------------

(Do this step logged in as root.)

If you are using Apache on Linux, edit your /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
(Red Hat 7.2) or /etc/apache/conf/httpd.conf (Debian 3.0) file to
include a VirtualHost section like this, where in this example
"/var/www/html/metamathsite" is the directory where the Metamath site
resides; then /var/www/html/metamathsite/index.html will be the home
page and /var/www/html/metamathsite/mirror.txt will be this file
(the file you are reading right now).

  # See http://www.apache.org/docs/vhosts/
  NameVirtualHost *
  <VirtualHost *>
  #    ServerAdmin webmaster@dummy-host.example.com
      DocumentRoot /var/www/html/metamathsite
      ServerName nl.metamath.org
      ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
      ErrorDocument 403 /unauthorized.html
  #    ErrorLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-error_log
  #    CustomLog logs/dummy-host.example.com-access_log common
  </VirtualHost>

Restart Apache with 'service httpd restart' (Red Hat) or
'apachectl restart' (Debian).


(Optional but highly desireable) Also add the virtual hosts
au.metamath.org, de.metamath.org, and us.metamath.org since that will
allow me to redirect to your mirror in the event that one of these
"permanent" mirrors goes offline.


3. Set up a nightly cron job to keep your mirror up-to-date
-----------------------------------------------------------

This step assumes there is a user mmadmin (for example) with full
permissions for the /var/www/html/metamathsite directory.

This step will set up a cron job to keep the site synchronized.  We will
assume you are logged in as user mmadmin.  Create the following script
and name it (for example) /home/mmadmin/mirrorsync.sh:

  #!/bin/sh
  rsync -vrltS -z --delete --delete-after --block-size=400 \
      rsync://rsync.metamath.org/metamath /var/www/html/metamathsite

Remember to change the script permission to "execute":

  chmod +x /home/mmadmin/mirrorsync.sh

This script should be run periodically as a cron job.  To set up the
cron job, type 'crontab -e', and in the vi editor session that results,
insert the line

  7 2 * * * /home/mmadmin/mirrorsync.sh

if you want it to run at 2:07AM every night.  To verify the crontab
entry, type 'crontab -l'.  Note:  the crontab file will be located at
/var/spool/cron/mmadmin (Red Hat) or /var/spool/cron/crontabs/mmadmin
(Debian), but it should not be edited directly.


4. Set up a public rsync server (optional)
------------------------------------------

(Do this step logged in as root.)

If you also wish to set up your site as a public rsync server, edit your
/etc/rsyncd.conf file (creating it if it doesn't exist) to look like
this (for Red Hat):

  [metamath]
      comment = metamath
      path = /var/www/html/metamathsite
      read only = yes
      list = yes
      uid = nobody
      gid = nobody

(On Debian, the line reading "gid = nobody" should be "gid = nogroup".)

Next, activate the rsync service if necessary:

  On Red Hat:  Type 'ntsysv' and enable rsyncd.  Type 'service xinetd
  restart' to start up the rsync server.

  On Debian:  If the file /etc/inetd.conf does not have a line starting
  'rsync stream tcp nowait...', then to put it in you should type

    update-inetd --add \
      'rsync stream tcp nowait root /usr/bin/rsync rsyncd --daemon'

In your firewall open the 'rsync' port (port 873).  From outside your
firewall, test with 'rsync nl.metamath.org::'  to verify that rsync is
working (it should respond with 'metamath metamath').

Now public users should be able to synchronize to your mirror with the
following command (typed in the _parent_ directory of metamathsite):

  rsync -vrltS -z --delete --delete-after \
      rsync://nl.metamath.org/metamath metamathsite


=======================================================================


Special instructions for mirror sites
-------------------------------------

(You can ignore this section if you followed the instructions above.)

1. If the Metamath site is not under a top-level URL root directory, please
update your robots.txt file per the robots.txt in this directory.

2. In your Apache configuration file, please point errors as follows for
the relevant virtual server:

  ErrorDocument 404 /missing.html
  ErrorDocument 403 /unauthorized.html

(or the equivalent for non-Apache web servers)

3. To keep the site up-to-date, run this command (usually as a cron job)
where $DIR/index.html is the Metamath home page:

  rsync -vrltS -z --delete --delete-after \
      rsync://rsync.metamath.org/metamath $DIR
