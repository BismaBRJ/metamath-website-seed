<h2>
A MOST FUNDAMENTAL FIXED POINT THEOREM&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<b>Alexander Abian</b></h2></center>

<p><br><DOUBLE>&nbsp; The following a most Fundamental Fixed Point Theorem
is proved in&nbsp;&nbsp; ZF&nbsp;&nbsp; set theory
<p><b>without the Axiom of Choice.</b>&nbsp; It is "<b> a most fundamental</b>"
in the sense that it gives a
<p>necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a fixed point
of a mapping of a set&nbsp;&nbsp; S
<p>into itself where absolutely no algebraic or analytic or order theoretic
or any other special
<p>structures are imposed on&nbsp;&nbsp; S.
<p>&nbsp; <b>THEOREM</b> (<b>Abian</b>). Let&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp;
be a mapping from a set S into itself. Then&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; has
a fixed point if
<p>and only if:
<br>&nbsp; There exists an element&nbsp;&nbsp; a&nbsp;&nbsp; of&nbsp;&nbsp;
P&nbsp;&nbsp; such that&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>k</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; is an
element of&nbsp;&nbsp; P&nbsp;&nbsp; for every ordinal&nbsp;&nbsp; k,&nbsp;&nbsp;
and
<br>for every ordinal&nbsp;&nbsp; v
<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp; if&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>v</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; is not a
fixed point of&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; then&nbsp; the&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>u</sup>(a)
's are all distinct for every ordinal&nbsp; u&nbsp; &lt; v.
<p>&nbsp; <b>PROOF.</b>&nbsp; First we show that (1) implies that&nbsp;&nbsp;
f&nbsp;&nbsp; has a fixed point.&nbsp; Assume on the contrary that&nbsp;&nbsp;
f
<p>&nbsp; has no fixed point and let&nbsp;&nbsp; p&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp;
q&nbsp;&nbsp; be any two distinct ordinal numbers.&nbsp; Clearly, there
always
<p>exists an ordinal&nbsp;&nbsp; v&nbsp;&nbsp; such that&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
p &lt; v&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; q &lt; v.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then
since by our assumption&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>v</sup>(a)
<p>cannot be a fixed point of&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; hence (1) implies
that&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>p</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>q</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;
are two distinct elements
<p>of&nbsp;&nbsp; S.&nbsp; Thus, our assumption implies that for every
two distinct ordinals&nbsp;&nbsp; p&nbsp;&nbsp; and&nbsp;&nbsp; q&nbsp;&nbsp;
there
<p>correspond two distinct elements&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>p</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;
and&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>q</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; of the set&nbsp;&nbsp; S.&nbsp;
Consequently, every ordinal can
<p>be assigned in a one-to-one way to every element of a subset of&nbsp;&nbsp;
S.&nbsp; But then the Axiom Scheme
<p>of Replacement of&nbsp;&nbsp; ZF&nbsp;&nbsp; would imply that the set
of all ordinals exists, which is a contradiction.
<p>Thus, our assumption is false and&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; has a fixed
point.
<p>&nbsp; Next, assume that&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;&nbsp; has a fixed point&nbsp;&nbsp;
a.&nbsp; Then&nbsp; (1 ) is obviously satisfied by setting
<p>a = f(a) = f<sup>k</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp; for every ordinal&nbsp;&nbsp;
k.
<p>&nbsp; Thus,&nbsp; the Theorem is proved.
<p>&nbsp; <b>REMARK.</b>&nbsp; Note that&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>k</sup>(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;
in the above does not necessarily indicate the k-th or any other
<p>iterates of&nbsp;&nbsp; f.&nbsp; Thus, it is not even required that&nbsp;
f(f<sup>k</sup>(a))&nbsp;&nbsp; be equal to&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>k+1</sup>(a).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Obviously, by
<p>"&nbsp; f<sup>k</sup>(a)&nbsp; is a fixed point of&nbsp;&nbsp; f&nbsp;
"&nbsp;&nbsp; is meant that&nbsp;&nbsp; f(f<sup>k</sup>(a))&nbsp;&nbsp;
=&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>k</sup>(a),&nbsp; and as mentioned above,
<p>without necessitating that&nbsp;&nbsp; f(f<sup>k</sup>(a))&nbsp;&nbsp;
be equal to&nbsp;&nbsp; f<sup>k+1</sup>(a).
<p>&nbsp; The fundamental significance of the Theorem lies in the fact
that a great many fixed point
<p>theorems can be reduced to the special cases of the Theorem, in as much
as, no special structures
<p>are required by the set&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp;&nbsp; to have, and, no iterative
rules are imposed on&nbsp;&nbsp; f.
