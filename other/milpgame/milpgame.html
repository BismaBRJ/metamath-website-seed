<p>Milpgame is a proof assistant and a checker (showing an error message
if something goes wrong) for the Metamath language.  You can enter the
demonstration (proof) either forward and backward relative to the
statement to prove.  Milpgame checks if a statement is well formed (the
program has a syntactic verifier).  You can save unfinished proofs
without the use of the <A HREF="../../mpeuni/a1ii.html">a1ii</A> theorem.
The demonstration is shown as a tree, and statements are shown using
HTML definitions (defined in the $t typesetting comment of the
database).  Milpgame is distributed as a Java .jar (JRE version 6 update
24 written in NetBeans IDE).  </p>

works</FONT></H4>

<p> You can save unfinished proofs in *.mlp format, which
 you can open later to complete the proof of the theorem or problem.

<br> If you
enter on "Edit -&gt; Search" and search for a theorem name, you can go to the
source of the theorem, and from there you can enter new proof.

<p> Download milpgame1.1a.zip, unzip it, and follow the instructions in
readme.txt.  For proving theorems using the current set.mm, download set.mm
from <a href="https://github.com/metamath/set.mm/blob/develop/set.mm">
Github/set.mm</a> and open the file with Milpgame.  System requirements:
2 GB of RAM and 1366x768 screen resolution.  </p>

<H3><FONT COLOR="#006633">Instructions for using Milpgame</FONT></H3>


<P>Milpgame cannot modify set.mm.  After you prove a theorem, you must
paste the proof into set.mm manually using a text editor.  Prior to the
proving, you must add to set.mm the theorem to be proved, accompanied by
an empty proof (that is, whose proof consists of the single character
"?"), using a text editor.

<P>After you start Milpgame, go to "File -&gt; Open" and choose the
set.mm file.  (To play with test1 through test6, you must download one of the
test.mm files and set04.06.2013.mm in the same folder and then Open the
test.mm in Milpgame.)

<P>When working with set.mm, Milpgame takes about 40 seconds to load,
depending on your CPU.

<P>Move the cursor to "Edit -&gt; Search", check "Search by name", and
enter the name of the theorem that you want to prove.  From the list
that appears, click on the desired theorem name and "Go" to the source.
Then click on the theorem and click on "Edit this proof" (a new tab will
appear).

<P>There are two strategies for proving theorems, called Forward
Chaining and Backward Chaining.

<H4><FONT COLOR="#006633">Forward Chaining Strategy</FONT></H4>

<P>In the tab with theorem name on it, click "Change strategy" to change
it to "Forward Chaining".  This strategy allows you to enter the proof
starting with the hypotheses and ending with the theorem statement.

<P>In order to prove the theorem, you must fill the "List of Rules" with
axioms, theorems and hypotheses.  The "List of Rules" can be filled with
axioms and theorems using "Edit -&gt; Search".  (You enter the name of axiom or
theorem in the place holder, check "Search by name", and click on "Search".
A list of results will appear.  Choose the axiom or theorem, then
click on "Add" to add it to the "List of Rules".)

<P>Any hypotheses of the theorem to be proved are listed after the "Edit
this proof" button.  To add a hypothesis to the "List of Rules", click
on the hypothesis then click on the "Add" button to add it to the "List
of Rules" as "Hypothesis...".

<P>In the following instructions, an axiom or theorem with no
hypotheses is called "simple", and one that has hypotheses is called
"complex".

<P>To assign a hypothesis to the proof, you must in enter it into the "List
of Rules" as described, click on the hypothesis, click "Select", then
click on "Apply Rule:  Hypothesis of ..."

<P>To assign a simple axiom or simple theorem to the proof, you must
enter it in the "List of Rules",
click on the axiom [theorem], click "Select", then click
"Apply Rule:  Axiom [Theorem] of ...".

<P>To move up or down through the hypotheses and statements, click on
"Move Up" or "Move Down".

<P>Undetermined variables are called "$v0", "$v1", etc.  In order to fill
in a variable (i.e. assign it to an expression), you must click on the
statement with the variable, then click on "Edit proof variables".  Fill
in the variable with a desired expression that qualifies for the
variable type (such as wff or class).

<P>To add a simple or complex theorem or axiom to the proof, you must
click on the statement, enter the "List of Rules", choose a theorem or
axiom, then click on "Apply Rule:  Theorem [or Axiom] of ...".

SIZE=-1><I>(The following 3 paragraphs were added on 5-Feb-2020.)</I></FONT>


<P>If you want to find a rule that fits with the ENTERED statement and
existing statements, you should follow these steps:  Between the border
of "Find the rules that fits", in the text pane you can enter the desired
statement (you can check the correctness by clicking the "Syntax check"
button), marked target must be null, enter the number of hypotheses that
rule should have, select the first existing statements by clicking on it
(label "Start with:" will show you the first selected statement from a
list of ordered statements), then you can click on "Search and apply the
rule". (If the number of hypotheses is 0 it is not necessary to have
selected a first existing statement.)

<P>If you just want to insert into the proof a new unproved statement,
you should do the following:  in the border of "Find the rules that fits",
in the text pane you can enter the desired statement (you can check the
correctness by clicking the "Syntax check" button); the marked target
must be null then click on "Insert the above statement".  (An unproved
statement must be not be identical with a theorem hypothesis because it
cannot be proved further, you just simply insert the theorem hypothesis.)

<P>If you want to find a rule that fits with the MARKED target statement
and existing statements you should do the following:  click on desired
target statement, click on "Mark the target" (the label "Marked that
is:"  will show the target statement), enter the number of hypotheses
that rule should have, select the first existing statements by clicking
(label "Start with:"  will show you the first selected statement from a
list of ordered statements), then you can click on "Search and apply the
rule".  (If the number of hypotheses is 0 it is not necessary to have
selected a first existing statement.)  After you enter a proof in
forward strategy you can get the text version (similar to mmj2) of the
proof by clicking on "Text version of the proof".


<H4><FONT COLOR="#006633">Backward Chaining Strategy</FONT></H4>

<P>In the tab with theorem name on it, click "Change strategy" to change
it to "Backward Chaining".  This will allow you to enter the proof
starting with the theorem statement and ending with the hypotheses.

<P>To add a simple or complex theorem or axiom to the proof, you must
click on the statement, enter the "List of Rules", choose a theorem or
axiom, then click on "Apply Rule:  Theorem [or Axiom] of ...".

<P>The instructions are similar for the case of a hypothesis.

<P>Undetermined variables are called "$v0", "$v1", etc.  In order to fill
in a variable (i.e. assign it to an expression), you must click on the
statement with the variable, then click on "Edit proof variables".  Fill
in the variable with a desired expression that qualifies for the
variable type (such as wff or class).



<H4><FONT COLOR="#006633">Additional instructions</FONT></H4>

<P>If you want to add an existing statement to the proof, click on "Add
an existing statement".  If you want to delete a branch, click on the
statement that you want to delete and then click "Delete branch".  The
"Syntax" button is used to show the syntactic definitions for wff,
class, and set variables.  In the "Edit -&gt; Formula" editor, you can
create a statement using symbols (HTML definitions) and then obtain the
corresponding ASCII result that can be used to edit set.mm (with a text
editor).

<H4><FONT COLOR="#006633">Memory usage</FONT></H4>

Milpgame version 0.9 requires about 700MB of memory when set.mm is
loaded.  To increase the memory used by the Java application, modify the
-Xmx number from run.bat, for example "-Xmx4500m" will provide for
4500MB.
