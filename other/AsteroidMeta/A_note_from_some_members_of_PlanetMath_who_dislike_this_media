browse"><h2>A note from some members of PlanetMath who dislike this
media</h2><p>This page is created as a reaction from some members of the
<a class="local"
href="PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>
community to this media, <a class="local"
href="AsteroidMeta">AsteroidMeta</a>
(or the Wiki).  The Wiki by no means represents the view of the <a
class="local"
href="PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>
community and only one page has an official character (<a class="local"
href="PlanetMath_Budget_and_Resources">PlanetMath
Budget and Resources</a>) to the best of my knowledge.  None of the
pages that are linked to that one have official character.  All other
pages (including this one!), views, opinions and comments are of those
individuals who sign them, and should not be taken as a view of the <a
class="local"
href="PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>
community.</p><p>Some thoughts:  developing documents in public is
definitely a good thing, if everyone has a chance to collaborate.
However, one must understand that some of us (<a class="local"
href="drini">drini</a>
and <a class="local"
href="alozano">alozano</a>
for example) have big issues with the way the Wiki is organized and
handled, which draw us away from participating in the Wiki.  My (<a
class="local"
href="alozano">alozano</a>)
main concern is the mix of official with unofficial pages.  It is true,
there is one single page that says "this is official" but even this one
links to a pleiades of unofficial pages.  Let me quote drini:</p><p>"I
gave up regularly tracking the wiki because it has a lot of fluf and
unrelated content to planetmath.  For every planetmath related content
there would be 10 pages of hdm, fem metastuff, philosophical essays,
personal writings, etc.  And the only way of trackign the wiki is with
recent changes which put everything mixed, it's certainly not easy and
discouraging.  And I think several other people feel the
same&#x2026;.[&#x2026;]&#x2026;but again, most (and I mean truly most)
pm users don't track the wiki and I don't think they will due to its
excessive noise/signal ratio."</p><p>I agree word by word with what
Drini says.  There is a huge mix of things in the Wiki.  How can
perspective funders of PM distinguish what is official from what is not,
what is a personal view from what is a PM opinion, what is a personal
goal from what is a PM goal??  To say the least, a disclaimer should be
written in the front page of the wiki, and explicitly and clearly state
what is official PM stuff.  Otherwise PM may be liable for content in
the wiki?!</p><p>Most worrying of all, is the non-existent involvement
of the rest of the board in the Wiki.  This should really feel alarming
to you, doesn't it?  From what it transpires in the google group and the
board meetings, the board itself is not very satisfied with the Wiki
either, or reluctant to use it.</p><p>I see benefits in the wiki:
public development; a very quick and interactive environment.  But these
points seem trumped if the members do not use it, or do not agree with
the way the wiki is organized to the point of refusing to use it.
Moreover, in the recent discussions Joe has hinted that if you are not
present in the wiki then you are out of the decision making.  So even if
we fundamentally disagree with the wiki, we are forced to use it?--<a
class="local"
href="alozano">alozano</a></p><h2>Discussion</h2><p>We
do have some empirical data that we can also use to understand the role
of the wiki.  Let me create right now a list of the most influential
people in <a class="local"
href="PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>,
up to date.  This list may be constructed in different ways, but here is
my own way:  first, I will include the "gods" or creators or cofounders
of <a class="local"
href="PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>
(akrowne (Aaron), unlord (Nathan Egge), logan (Logan Hanks)).  Then, I
will include the members who have contributed more than 10000 points to
the project (those are 18 members:  pahio, matte, mathcam, drini,
rspuzio, djao, akrowne, CWoo, alozano, rmilson, bwebste, yark, Koro,
Henry, bbukh, mathwizard, jirka and Daume).  Last but not least, I will
include Joe Corneli who, no doubt, is one of the most influential people
around and who has also contributed a great deal.  So that's the full
list.  I am sure I am leaving important people out, but as I said this
is just one way of making such a list.  Now, I will write the list and
write comments next to each name, to say whether the user is a Wiki-user
or not.  By user of the Wiki, I mean <b>contributor</b>.  Some of them
may be reading it, but not contributing, as far as I know (please
correct me otherwise).</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd><a class="local"

only 7 contribute to the wiki (to different degrees), and 2 of those
have expressed mixed feelings about it.  I will not attempt to say who
of the above is actually involved or not in <a class="local"
href="PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>
organization, because that is hard to say.  Also, I do not know the
reasons of the above to not contribute in the wiki.  However, I still
believe that the number of users who do contribute to the Wiki is rather
low, even alarming, which is why I brought up the issue of the wiki in
the first place.  So we should investigate why people are not
participating there and I invite everyone again to express their opinion
of the wiki, so we can improve the community.--<a class="local"
href="alozano">alozano</a></p><h2>Constructive
Ideas</h2><p>One partial solution that comes to mind is to split
completely the official stuff from the rest of the Wiki.  This amounts
to building another wiki which only has official stuff, starting from
the front page.  That way the "recent changes page" would only archive
changes in official stuff.  --<a class="local"
href="alozano">alozano</a></p><p>I
think thats a reasonable idea.  I will think about this and am open to
this and other suggestions.  --<a class="local"
href="akrowne">akrowne</a>
Sat Mar 18 19:51:22 UTC 2006</p><p>There would be no problem with this,
but bear in mind that there are only 3 or so "official" things at this
point (articles of incorporation, bylaws, and the <a class="local"
href="PlanetMath.org">PlanetMath.org</a>
page.  Most of the discussion is going to be "unofficial".  --<a
class="local"
href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a></p><p>That's
only a reason in favor of the split in my opinion, because it is very
hard to discern the 3 only official pages from the unofficial ones.
--<a class="local"
href="alozano">alozano</a></p><p>There
is very little to be lost in providing separate streams; those who want
both can still combine them.  --<a class="local"
href="akrowne">akrowne</a>
Mon Mar 20 23:14:47 UTC 2006</p><p>Let's come up with a concrete
proposal that we can then debate.  First of all, let's start by being
concrete about which pages are being thought of as "official".  --<a
class="local"
href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a></p><dl
class="quote"><dt /><dd>A proposal:  split pages dealing with Planetmath
only (official or not, may be distinguished by some tag) from the rest
of the peripheral things, so those who are only interested on PM (as
encyclopedia) and not on AI and other things don't get discouraged my
the everything-mixed approach --<a class="local"
href="drini">drini</a><dl
class="quote"><dt /><dd>Note:  your PM-centric view of AM is not
realistic.  No project here is any more "peripheral" than any other,
i.e., this is supposed to be a wiki about free CBPP in general.  Now,
certainly, if someone wants to start a PM-only wiki, I'm sure that
wouldn't be a problem, or if someone wanted to go to the lengths of
setting up an Oddwiki-style "motherwiki" for the various projects, we
could do that too.  It doesn't really matter to me.  However, good luck
figuring out which pages deal with PlanetMath only!  Although the wiki
is not PM-centric, I think all of the other projects are PM-related.
--<a class="local"
href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a><dl
class="quote"><dt /><dd>How about the <a class="local"
href="PlanetMath">PlanetMath</a>
page?  Doesn't that already split the PM-related stuff from everything
else?  If you only want to see the PM-related stuff on this, simply
browse this website starting from that homepage.  Maybe the "Wiki" link
on the PM homepage ought to be redireected to this page rather than to
the overall AM homepage.--<a class="local"
href="rspuzio">rspuzio</a></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>I
believe Drini used the term "peripheral" in a relative, not an absolute
sense.  Since his vision is focussed on PM, anything else is peripheral
to his field of view.  Likewise Ocat and Norm might regard PM as
periheral and metamath as central.  As for me, I like having a periphery
to my vision because it helps me to stay well-rounded and find out about
things which I might not otherwise care to seek out.</p><p>In recent
conversations, Joe, Aaron, and I have considered the possiblity of
setting up a wiki category system.  What that would allow is to add
metatdata to pages in the form of backwards links so that we could, say,
mark all the pages having to do with PM stuff or official PM pages as
such and the computer would automatically compile a directory of
PM-related stuff.  Then, if we were to redirect the link on the main
page of PM to this directory of PM-related stuff on AM rather than to
the AM homepage.  This way, someone who was interested in PM stuff could
see a listing of just the pages directly related to PM (which would be
broken into further subcategories such as "official", "organizational",
"content", "discussion", "related interest" and "miscellaneous" for
further ease of navigation).  So my questions to Alozano, Drini, and
other critics of this media are:  Would you consider such a system as
adressing the complaints you raise?  Are there other problems which this
would not adress?  Were such a system implemented, how would you feel
about using the wiki for discussing PM-related stuff?  --<a
class="local"
href="rspuzio">rspuzio</a></p><p>The
most cost-effective approach would probably be to create a pure-PM wiki,
and leave "the Asteroid" for non-PM discussions.  I notice that the PM
discussions using message threads are very popular, and it would seem
that a wiki approach to some of those discussions would be beneficial.
Likewise, having this wiki for non-PM discussions is beneficial for
Friends of Metamath and HDM&#x2026;</p><p>&#x2026;I remember way, way
back in July(?) 2005 when I located Joe on google and found a home for
mmj2.  Since then we have made some really great progress, with nearly a
dozen software works related to Metamath submitted by people all over
the world.  And mmj2 has benefited from the input by very smart people
&#x2013; the 11/1 release is actually fairly decent, as these things go
(Hilbert-style Proof Assistanting GUI's&#x2026;)</p><p>I think we're
making progress in the software of math/logic &#x2013; which is not a
trivial subject, and I think, of great potential benefit to Planet
Earth.  Yes, there are other projects elsewhere, but building expertise
requires <b>doing</b>&#x2026; Based on what we have done here and
learned about what people like and don't like, the vision is a lot more
clear now.  God willing we'll all do great things in the
future.</p><p>The first release of mmj2, here on 8/29/2005 consisted of
existing inventions, such as the Earley Parser and the Metamath Proof
Verification algorithm.  But a lot of actual <b>invention</b> has taken
place since then with the help of the people at this wiki.  For example,
the mmj2 ProofUnifier<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page"
rel="nofollow"
href="/web/20120104125833/http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit;id=ProofUnifier">?</a>.java
program has some interesting ideas about computing a digital "signature"
or "characteristic" for a parse tree and contains a series of tests
enabling "fast failure" of candidates for unification (more work would
be needed for a system containing 1 million assertions rather than a
mere 10,000).  And the 11/1 release contains formula formatting
algorithms that were invented specifically for mmj2
("TwoColumnAlignment<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page"
rel="nofollow"
href="/web/20120104125833/http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit;id=TwoColumnAlignment">?</a>"
and "AlignColumn<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page"
rel="nofollow"
href="/web/20120104125833/http://wiki.planetmath.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=edit;id=AlignColumn">?</a>").
Those can be adapted from TMFF (text mode formula formatting) to the
future GMFF (graphics mode formula formatting).</p><p>This is progress,
1000+ mmj2 person hours of progress!  But just a start.  No matter how
great mmj2 might be, it will always be unpopular &#x2013; until the day
comes when math/logicians can input via digital pens, voice recognition,
VR gloves, etc., and get their output back in graphic form in the
Mathematical Vernacular they already know.  When math/logicians can just
write formulas on a virtual electronic blackboard, with the software
simultaneously analyzing and unifying and validating in the background
&#x2013; and conversing with the math/logician as needed for
clarification &#x2013; then the system might become popular.  And of
course we'll need digital audio-visual training materials and textbooks
to provide a framework&#x2026;if we could hire that Buffy The Vampire
Slayer girl to teach logic in videos, I bet the subject would become a
lot more popular than it is now.</p><p>--<a class="local"
href="ocat">ocat</a></p><p>I
don't know if it was <a class="local"
href="CWoo">CWoo</a>
himself who touched this page, indicating that he doesn't contribute to
the wiki&#x2026; but of course in either event, he has contributed at
least a little.  And anyway, I'm glad someone did touch this page, since
the issue here seems to be a worthwhile thing to talk about now.</p><p>I
think that <em>if the main point of contention for PlanetMath people is
having PlanetMath stuff mixed in with everything else, not the more
basic nature of having a wiki, then Ocat's suggestion, which others have
had before, is a good one, and someone could just follow
it.</em></p><p>A while ago, I wrote a page comparing <a class="local"
href="the_relative_merits_of_wiki_and_other_workflow_management_media">the
relative merits of wiki and other workflow management media</a>.  I am
not jumping up and down in excitement about wiki &#x2013; but it has
been a reasonably helpful communication tool for a lot of people
(including Ocat, as described above, and myself).  I think this issue of
communication platform is really important &#x2013; important enough
that after working on that page, I became very involved with looking for
the new best thing since wikis.  (For information on this work in
progress, see <a class="local"
href="Arxana">Arxana</a>/<a
class="local"
href="MUSN">MUSN</a>.)</p><p>At
the same time, I think the issue of "which communication platform to use
and is it really the best?" shouldn't stop people from having useful and
valuable communications.  In the same way Ocat has invested many hours
into <a class="local"
href="mmj2">mmj2</a>
with nary a digital pen in sight, those people who want to pioneer any
new field will have to work with less-than-perfect conditions, fueled
mainly by their vision of what <em>could</em> be.</p><p>This all leads
me, in a somewhat round-about way, to ask a sort of reverse of the
question in italics above:  if the problem with Asteroid isn't its
wiki-nature, maybe the problem is with PlanetMath's nature.  I don't
mean that the problem is fatal:  I think of it more as a problem of
definition than a problem of logic.  What is central for people using
PlanetMath?  What is "peripheral"?  Actually, as has already been
illustrated by the small bunch of people using this wiki, the answers
will be widely different for different PlanetMath users.</p><p>This
suggests that if we take a user-centric view of PlanetMath, we are
already involved with a somewhat strange geometry.  PlanetMath is
covered by "cells" and these cells bear gaussians on them; the covering
map is the user's attention.  We could say that the most "central" thing
is the thing that collects the most density under this collective
attention-mapping function.  But this could be misleading, because it
doesn't take into account the ambient space that PlanetMath exists
within.  For example, there's <a class="local"
href="Noosphere">Noosphere</a>,
there's <a class="local"
href="LaTeX">LaTeX</a>,
there's the <a class="local"
href="ArXiv">ArXiv</a>,
there's <a class="local"
href="Metamath">Metamath</a>
and <a class="local"
href="GNU">GNU</a>
and <a class="local"
href="Wikipedia">Wikipedia</a>
and many other related things.  Maybe the central point of PlanetMath
doesn't actually lie in PlanetMath at all.  The weighted average of
everyone's attention might turn out to be some point that no one is
giving much attention to.</p><p>And this might turn out to be a real
tragedy-of-the-commons situation.</p><p>And if this isn't enough
abstraction, let me add one more little layer of interest &#x2013; which
is that in addition to this base manifold and its attention density,
there is also an <em>activity density</em> that causes the manifold to
change over time.  We are not all just passive viewers.  As Ocat said
above, "building expertise requires <b>doing</b>".  Really, building
anything requires doing, but I still think expertise may be the ideal
word-choice for people to use when talking about PlanetMath, since we
are all building our own expertise, and also impacting our ability to
"learn better".  This is what math is all about, from the very
beginning.</p><p>The <a class="local"
href="HDM">HDM</a>
project says that we should be able to take all this effort and produce
an "expert system" for mathematics out of it, so again the word
expertise works.  Of course, the HDM requires more and different work
from what is going on at PlanetMath currently.  Nevertheless, there
seems to be a reasonable overlap between the interests of "PlanetMath
people" and the interests of "HDM people" and the interests of third
parties who have a bit of time to share with one or both of these
projects.  Is HDM "central" for PlanetMath?  Most likely not, if only
because most people don't think about it that way.  Should it be
supported by PlanetMath?  Well, this is part of that problem of
definition I was talking about.  I don't really know what the answer is,
but I do want to put the question out there, as a paradigmatic question.
There are many others that we should be asking and talking about as
well.</p><p>--<a class="local"
