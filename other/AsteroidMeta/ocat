    to solve. So the solver must first create the problem, or more
    often recreate it. And, of course, you have to replace any that
    you actually get rid of. That's the usual function of 
    organizations: to help one create new problems or take old 
    ones out of mothballs. [...] Organizations carry it beyond that
    level--to the point of engineering, promoting, and enforcing
    problems. I'm sure you've noticed how their solutions provide 
    a next generation of bigger and better problems. Call it a game
    of posing and resolving problems."

If the use of these assistants becomes widespread, they could change deeply mathematics as it is currently practiced. One long-term dream is to have formal proofs of all of the central theorems in mathematics. Thomas Hales, one of the authors writing in the Notices, says that such a collection of proofs would be akin to "the sequencing of the mathematical genome".</p></div><div class="footer"><hr /><span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="HomePage">HomePage</a> <a class="local" href="RecentChanges">RecentChanges</a> </span><span class="edit bar"><br /> <a class="edit" accesskey="e" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=ocat">Edit this page</a> <a class="history" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=history;id=ocat">View other revisions</a> <a class="admin" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=admin;id=ocat">Administration</a></span><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-11-06 22:46 UTC by <a class="author" title="from pool-96-249-204-163.snfcca.dsl-w.verizon.net" href="ocat">ocat</a> <a class="diff" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=browse;diff=1;id=ocat">(diff)</a></span><form method="get" action="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
