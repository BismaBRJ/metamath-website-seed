    PROBLEM:  "E-PA-0403 is useless and prevents that 
              things go smooth (?)" --[[fl]]
     
    SOLUTION: 
     
    E-PA-0403 now has code:
     
        public static final String ERRMSG_INCOMPLETE_HYPS_1 =
            "E-PA-0403 Theorem ";
        public static final String ERRMSG_INCOMPLETE_HYPS_2 =
            " Step ";
        public static final String ERRMSG_INCOMPLETE_HYPS_3 =
            ": Proof incomplete for derivation proof step."
            + " The step was successfully unified with Ref ";
        public static final String ERRMSG_INCOMPLETE_HYPS_4 =
            ", but one (or more) of the step's hypotheses"
            + " has an incomplete Hyp value (='?').";
     
     
    The motivation for this message is that an "incomplete
    Hyp value (='?')" is not an Error, and does not 
    generate an error message (assuming that Ref = blank,
    etc.) 
      
    So, if E-PA-0403 were not displayed, the user would
    sometimes hit Ctrl-U and see no result! It would
    appear to the user that mmj2 did NOTHING...and then
    the user would blame Mel O'Cat for putting a bug into
    the code.
     
    I will be happy to review a specific example of a proof
    worksheet which produces E-PA-0403 after Ctrl-U and
    you believe the message is bogus (should not appear.)

    PROBLEM:  "When you come across a theorem (without 
              premisses) like pnfxr or pnfget in ioosre,
              mmj2 doesn't identify the theorem automatically." --[[fl]]
          
    SOLUTION: 
     
    I have tested ioossre's steps 7 (pnfget) and step 9 (pnfxr)
    both ways: 1) erase the Ref (theorem label) and leave formula
    intact, then hit Ctrl-U; and 2) erase formula and leave
    Ref intact, then hit Ctrl-U. 
     
    In both instances of *my* testing, mmj2 correctly 
    filled in the Ref label or the formula.
     
    BUT there are cases where "Unification Search" does
    not take place during Ctrl-U processing. 
     
    By "Unification Search" I mean the search for a Ref
    label that unifies with the step formula (conclusion)
    and the step hypotheses. The search proceeds from
    the first assertion in the input .mm and proceeds
    up to, but not including, the theorem being proved
    (excluding assertions excluded by RunParm request.)
     
    *WHEN* a proof step or its hypotheses contain Work
    Variables, or when the Ref label is non-blank and
    either the formula is blank or one of the Hyp
    fields is missing, THEN Unification Search is not
    performed. 
     
    Soooo...assume this is the situation in ioossre:
     
     
    7::                |- ( &amp;C1  e. RR* -&gt; &amp;C1  &lt;_ +oo )
    8::mnfxr           |- -oo e. RR*
    9::pnfxr           |- +oo e. RR*
    10::iooss2         |- (  (  ( -oo e. RR* /\ &amp;C1   e. RR* /\ +oo e. RR* )
                             /\ &amp;C1   &lt;_ +oo )
                          -&gt; ( -oo (,) &amp;C1   ) (_ ( -oo (,) +oo ) )
    11:9,10:mp3anl3    |- (  ( ( -oo e. RR* /\ &amp;C1   e. RR* ) /\ &amp;C1   &lt;_ +oo )
                          -&gt; ( -oo (,) &amp;C1   ) (_ ( -oo (,) +oo ) )
    12:8,11:mpanl1     |- (  ( &amp;C1   e. RR* /\ &amp;C1   &lt;_ +oo )
                          -&gt; ( -oo (,) &amp;C1   ) (_ ( -oo (,) +oo ) )
    13:7,12:mpdan      |- ( &amp;C1   e. RR* -&gt; ( -oo (,) &amp;C1   ) (_ ( -oo (,) +oo ) )
     
    NOW...hit Ctrl-U: the Ref in 7 will be loaded with "pnfget"
    automatically AFTER Work Variable &amp;C1 is resolved
    (to "B"). 
     
    And in fact, if you substitute that excerpt into
    the ioossre Proof Worksheet and hit Ctrl-U, the
    &amp;C1 Work Variables are all updated automatically.
     
    Here is how the process works in Proof Unifier
    (the short version):
     
    1) Steps involving Work Variables, or which require
    DeriveHypotheses or DefiveFormula, are processed
    using the new StepUnifier.
     
    2) Steps that are still not unified but are not
    in error and don't have Work Variables now, that 
    contain a non-blank Ref label are unified using
    the old ProofUnifier logic.
     
    3) Any remaining steps still not unified and
    error free, with no Work Variables, are sent through
    the UnificationSearch process -- and if a Ref
    is found to unify a step, the step is unified
    using the old ProofUnifier logic. (Also, "Hints"
    are generated during the single pass through
    the assertion table.)
     
    4) Finalization: build proofs for unified steps,
    or produce error messages for un-unified steps,
    and output any Hints, etc. 
     
    I will be happy to review a specific example of a proof
    worksheet which does not produce Ref labels pnfget
    or pnfxr (assertion with zero hypotheses) after Ctrl-U 
    if you believe the processing is incorrect. Please
    send me examples so that I can perform further
    analysis -- and add test cases for later use in
    regression testing. (Thanks!)

    PROBLEM:  "There is no let command to replace all the 
              variables by a subformula." --[[fl]]
               
    SOLUTION: 
     
    I agree that this is a "nice to have" feature. It would
    be nice to have a full Search/Replace feature!
     
    However...with the new StepUnifier algorithm, it is not
    necessary to manually replace *all* occurrences of a
    given Work Variable. Just update one, say, change 
    "&amp;C1" to "B", and, because the proof steps are logically
    linked, once unification is achieved *all* occurrences
    of "&amp;C1" will be automatically updated to "B" (assuming
    that does not create any inconsistencies elsewhere...
    and assuming that the "&amp;C1"s are linked -- which would
    be the case if mmj output the &amp;C1's (if you manually
    enter a bunch of &amp;C1's in different proof steps they
    may not be consistent and linked logically.)
     
    ALSO, there is another workaround. Use a text editor.
    For example, my text editor can edit a Proof Worksheet
    *while* it is open in the mmj2 PA GUI. So, the procedure
    would be to Save in the GUI, ALT-Tab to the editor,
    re-get the file, make the changes and Save in the 
    editor, then re-get in the GUI. Simple... :-) Not.
    But you shouldn't need to do that very often -- hardly
    at all, actually...
     
    The new mmj2 unification algorithm in StepUnifier.java
    differs from the Metamath.exe PA because mmj2 knows the
    parse tree of the formulas it is trying to unify. So
    it does not ask you to choose between two different
    unification candidate expressions.
     
    Still, there is the case where the Hyp entries are
    input in the wrong order (not matching the Hypotheses
    of the Ref), and the Ref Hypotheses all have the
    same shape (e.g. "|- A e. V" &amp;&amp; "|- B e. V" &amp;&amp; 
    "|- C e. V", etc.) mmj2 selects the first Hypothesis
    order it finds that *works* -- that unifies 
    successfully. Sometimes there is more than one
    possible unification -- using a different Hyp
    order. In that case, use "Undo" and then change
    the order of the entries in the Hyp field of the
    proof step in question.
