Using the LaTeX version they provide, it adds 10 pages to the book! The cost of the book will increase accordingly, and it seems like a waste of trees.

If, hypothetically speaking, those quotes were a copyright infringement, then there can be downstream copyright infringments once the document is transfered to public domain (this is one of the reasons that one should be "careful" to make sure that things that advertise themselves as being public domain actually are). However, since you say that you are in fact making fair use of the quotations, people who use the document under public domain terms aren't committing any crime. --<a class="local" href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a></p><h1>General Discussion</h1><h2>Ghilbert?</h2><p>I have begun a comparative analysis of Ghilbert in relation to Metamath. Ghilbert contains some interesting ideas. The Python code to verify a Ghilbert proof doesn't appear to be a problem (don't need it), and the files referenced at ghilbert.org contain a Metamath copyright from 2003 &#x2013; but since then Norman Megill has put set.mm into the public domain via a "Creative Commons" license (no, public domain is technically not a "license"; one places works into the public domain with a declaration &#x2013; <a class="local" href="raph">raph</a>), and the rest of Metamath is GPL'd. So is the IP status of the Ghilbert design the issue here? The design document states, "Ghilbert can largely be considered to be a patch on Metamath to improve those weaknesses." So where is the beef? Ghilbert patents? Does someone want to contact Raph Levien and find out &#x2013; because for sure if he wants Ghilbert to become a planetary standard he will want people to use his file specifications. --<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></p><p>My intent is for Ghilbert to be very, very free, and sorry for not making that clearer. I haven't done a careful release just out of laziness, but when I do it will definitely be either GPL or less restrictive. The set.mm database that I've converted to Ghilbert syntax should have the same copyright as the original, which as ocat points out above is none at all. As it happens, over the last year or so I've done a ton of work on Ghilbert that I have not yet released, including a nearly complete interpretation of HOL logic in ZFC set theory, and a development of predicate calculus that's more decoupled from set theory than Norm's version in set.mm (for example, his definition of substitution uses set abstraction). In any case, I'm more than willing to discuss Ghilbert, its design, and so on, but am a little unsure about the netiquette. I don't want to just barge in here and create a ton of pages; perhaps it would be more appropriate to do the gardening of <a class="url outside" href="http://ghilbert.org/">ghilbert.org</a> and put some more detailed writing there.--<a class="local" href="raph">raph</a></p><h2>Metamath and logic agnosticism</h2><p>One question for the metamathematically minded people investigating this software package is: how does metamath "do" logic agnosticism? Can you explain this to the rest of us in concrete terms (I know, it is asking a lot to be concrete about metamathematics!) Are there examples in alternate logics? Does anyone care to try to do some math in weird logics (e.g. using category theory instead of set theory as the basis of mathematical reality)? Don't get too overwhelmed (or too overwhelming), but it would be interesting to see something about these topics. --<a class="local" href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a> Sun Jun 19 01:28:40 2005 UTC</p><p>Tenative Answer: Metamath has no built-in logic or definition of "truth". A valid proof is simply a reverse polish notation sequence of statement labels that when fed into the Proof Verification engine exactly recreates the formula being proved. The Proof engine itself may be termed a stack-based automaton. The difference between a Proof and the RPN version of a formula's parse tree is that the parse tree's RPN can refer only to syntax axioms and variable hypotheses, while a proof can, in addition, refer to any previously defined logical hypothesis or assertion. "Proving" is simply the work involved in substituting expressions for variables &#x2013; and ensuring that only valid substitutions are performed (there is much to be said about "Type Codes", which are implicit in Metmath but don't get a whole lot of airtime in Metamath.pdf.)</p><p>Metamath includes a rather large Quantum Logic database (ql.mm), as well as a very instructive work by Bob Solovay, peano.mm. In addition, set.mm's axioms are defined throughout the file, as needed, so it is possible to see how far one can get using the "Intuitionist" approach--<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></p><p>Cool, thanks for the answer. Ray put together some <a class="local" href="template_utilities">template utilities</a> that seem similar on a mechanical level, and has just recently been talking in more theoretical terms about "<a class="local" href="Terms,_Definitions,_and_Systems_of_Axioms">Terms, Definitions, and Systems of Axioms</a>" (the ideas there again seem similar, on a theory level). --<a class="local" href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a> Sun Aug 07 01:01:40 2005 UTC</p><p>I created a page showing several Grammars recently extracted from key Metamath databases: <a class="local" href="metamath-Grammars">metamath-Grammars</a> Perhaps the information will be interesting? I know set.mm rocked my world when I tried my hand at writing a "naive" parser, and the Bottom Up algorithm will not complete set.mm before next Friday (but Earley Parser works fine, about 8 seconds for building the grammar, validating and parsing.) The problem isn't the size of the database but the complexity of some of the statements (very!) I think the job of OCR'ing arbitrary math texts will definitely entail handling Notations that are challenging, and their Grammars will perhaps be very challenging as well. <a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a> Sun Aug 07 01:22:22 2005 EDT</p><p>(<a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> here) In addition to the examples mentioned by <a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a>, the Metamath Solitaire applet demonstrates implicational logic, intuitionist propositional calculus, modal logic, modal provability logic, Euclidean geometry, and weak D-complete logic. The applet's axioms can be used as the starting points for Metamath theorem databases in these logics for anyone interested in them.</p><p>Category theory can be done in Metamath by extending the ZFC axioms with the Grothendieck axiom (Metamath book, p. xii).</p><p>As for other "weird logics," one interesting example I'd like to investigate some day is quantum set theory, proposed by Takeuti. It has the strange property that quantum-set equality is non-Leibnizian, i.e. x = y does not necessarily imply x \in z iff y \in z for all z.</p><p>Most "weird logics" such as intuitionistic, relevance, quantum logic, etc. are weak fragments of classical logic, i.e. all of their theorems hold in classical logic. A very interesting exception is the family of paraconsistent logics. For example, one such system has an axiom called "relativity", ((A &#x2192; B) &#x2192; B) &#x2192; A, which does not hold in classical logic!</p><p>I agree that Metamath is "logically agnostic"; that is an interesting way to describe it that I haven't heard before. Specifically, it can implement all the above logics natively, since you tell it what the axioms are, starting from an empty framework that is devoid of any logic at all. Most other proof languages presuppose a fixed built-in logic that is usually classical. This is not to say that they can't work with the above logics, just that they must deal with them as external mathematical objects rather than doing their proofs directly in the logics themselves. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 6 Sep 2005</p><p>Agnostic &#x2013; noncommittal &#x2013; <b>is</b> a better description than "catholic" &#x2013; broad or liberal scope.</p><p><a class="url" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=catholic">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=catholic</a></p><p>--<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></p><h1>Metamath content</h1><p>I'm interested in using metamath to explore propositional and predicate calculus using a natural deduction based system of axioms.

Although the old syntax was unambiguous, it did not allow for LALR parsing of the syntax constructions in set.mm, and the proof that it was unambiguous was tricky. The new syntax moves us closer to LALR parsability. Hopefully it improves readability somewhat as well by using a distinguished symbol. Thanks to Peter Backes for suggesting this change.</p><p>Originally I considered "&#x2026;" under the symbol to vaguely suggest "something goes here," i.e. the index range in the 2-dimensional notation, but in the end I picked the underline for its simplicity (and Peter prefered it over the dots). Of course I am open to suggestion and can still change it. In the distant future, there may be a 2-dimensional typesetting to display Metamath notation (probably programmed by someone other than me), but for now it is an interesting challenge to figure out the "most readable" 1-dimensional representation of textbook notation, where the symbol string maps 1-1 to the ASCII database symbols.</p><p>iuniin is the same as before but has an expanded comment, and also illustrates the new notation.</p><p>(18-Oct-05) Today we show a shorter proof of the venerable theorem id.

The preferred approach is to <b>make</b> the grammar fit LALR(k) for some k, thus "proving" the grammar to be unambiguous. And if that is done, then standard tools can generate a parser, which is an added benefit.

Later, HDM can presumably write conversions for Earth's other great math systems and snarfle up their content &#x2013; as permitted by law and consent of the owners.

Bourbaki and Ghilbert provide additional language capabilities. A conversion to Metamath wouldn't necessarily preserve 100% of information in every file/database in these languages -- that would depend on the content. So Metamath could be considered a lowest common denominator, a base. The beauty of having a common "base" language and converters to/from these other languages is portability amongst themselves, as well as the obvious benefit to HDM of having, potentially one day, tens of thousands of proven, consistent theorems in various axiom systems starting  from the bare metal of logic. Then when you have a "standard", mainline HDM ontology, it should be possible to reconcile  everything, assimilate it all, including the FEM entries, and detect duplicates, congruencies, etc. --<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></dd></dl><p>Ghilbert's design was driven in very large part by the desire to allow smooth translations to and from other systems.

Now if I use this new system to derive another set of theorems and if once again I replace one of the axioms by one of the new derived theorems I get a third system still sound and still <i>less</i> complete than the two previous ones. If we call T1, T2, T3 the sets of theorems we can obtain in each system I think we have T3 is included in T2 and T2 is included in T1.

Someone naive looking at grothprim might think, "my god, what an incredibly tedious proof" when in fact it was one of the most trivial.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>alephfp was extreme in the other direction. That proof was so frustrating for me, and I went through so many false starts due to mistakes in my rough sketches, that in the end I just brute-forced it, almost in anger, by writing out everything in such meticulous detail that it <em>couldn't</em> be wrong. And, in a funny way, writing out the details, even to the point of copying the same subexpressions from one line to the next instead of some shorthand like a box representing them, provided a subconcious excuse not to have to think so hard, providing mental breaks between the hard thinking. And possibly writing things out in such detail may have provided subconcious clues to the hard thinking via some kind of osmosis, who knows.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>Thinking back to alephfp, why didn't I just type it in (say in an editor, forgetting about metamath for the moment)? I'm not sure. It just seemed more natural to write that one (and most of my sketches) on paper, which I could stare at and think through while pacing, etc. Also, the metamath ascii wears out my thumb (space bar) as Raph has noted. There have been proofs that I've done the sketches for in a text editor, sometimes using an abbreviated pidgin math (one letter per symbol, no spaces except to separate blocks whose parens might be omitted for brevity) invented for the one-time purpose of the problem. The editor lets me copy and paste subexpressions carried from step to step. But this is usually when I already know roughly what the proof will look like and just need a more detailed sketch; the hard stuff is always on paper initially.</dd></dl></dl><ul><li>Is it true that &#x2013; when you are "in the zone" -- that you are working at a sub-verbal level?

I am just encoding existing knowledge. But given that, there are many, many proofs in the literature that are so sketchy that I have doubts that the author actually worked out the details. Or maybe the author did, in his/her head, and left the details as an implicit exercise/torture for the reader. Nonetheless, it is suprisingly rare (although not unheard of) that the final theorem being proved is actually wrong. It is almost like the mathematician is able to "see" that a theorem is true before proving it, and the proof is just a nuisance to be worked out in just enough detail to convince his/her colleagues. Sometimes I discover that there are additional assumptions that the author has left unstated, e.g. that a certain set must be nonempty for the theorem to hold. But in such a case, it usually is nonempty in the theorem's final application, so I don't know whether the author knew that it had to be nonempty for the theorem to hold and just omitted it as an irrelevant distraction. It can be an additional complication in formalizing the proof, though, since I may not know what the actual theorem will look like until the proof is worked out in detail.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>Unlike most mathematicians, I often do not feel confident in my own proofs with the sparse level of detail that is typical. This can make me feel not as smart as them, and I am often in awe the things they are able to prove that way yet not make a mistake. Most computer programmers can't do this, since their programs almost always have bugs. (I know some computer programmers are mathematicians and vice-versa, and there seems to be something intrinsically different about the two activities. But deep mathematical proofs seem to have as many possiblities for error as a typical computer program, if not more, with subtle special cases where a statement may not be true and that can't be overlooked, and it amazes me that there aren't more errors. Something like Wiles' proof boggles the mind.) I think that many mathematicians have an ability to perceive things at a much higher level than I am able to, and this seems to be a talent that you are either born with or not. I am to able perceive things this way to a certain extent, since I obviously have to understand the proofs to formalize them, but it is often after much pain and hair-pulling. The whole point of Metamath was to try to bring this down to a lower level that people such as myself who aren't so gifted could understand, and the fact that a computer can "understand" it means, to me, that in principle I can too. But I digress&#x2026;</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>To answer your question, among these subgoals are often problems whose proof initially eludes me, and those of course aren't in the book if each subgoal equals a book sentence. Often I can't solve them right away, and the answer will sometimes come the next day, almost automatically. When I first started set theory 12 years ago, the proof of pwpw0 was so frustratingly elusive that I went to the MIT library and looked in virtually every set theory book, and none of them had the proof worked out formally. It was always presented as an "obvious" step towards some other result. It's not that I didn't believe it - to me it was also "obvious," intuitively - it's just that I couldn't figure out how to <em>formalize</em> it. It was 5 days before I finally figured it out on my own, going to sleep each night thinking about it. Given the set.mm tools available at that point, it ended up requiring a very tricky (to me at the time) theorem of predicate calculus, exintr, that I'd never seen in a book and had to stumble across on my own. In restrospect, pwpw0 now seems trivial to me, and in the database its proof is currently reduced to 1 step (using another result). Perhaps I should put back my original proof for history's sake. (Later - for anyone who is curious, the original proof is still at the de2.metamath.org "archive" site: <a class="url outside" href="http://de2.metamath.org/mpegif/pwpw0.html">pwpw0</a>. It is embarrassing to admit that it took 5 days to figure this out - you can see exintr in step 6 - but maybe it will help others who are struggling with formal proofs not to feel so bad.:) )<dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>The essential difference between computer programming and proving mathematical theorems is, in Metamath terminology, that a Metamath proof cannot modify the proof statement stack. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a> 24-Sep-2006<dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>A minor nit.

Most of it is involved in figuring out how to formalize the original proof, independent of Metamath, which means the proof and all of its hidden assumptions and leaps of logic "left to the reader" must be figured out in complete detail and understood perfectly. Once that is done, for me the process of translating it to Metamath is pretty mechanical and not usually not very painful if painful at all. The things I hate the most is having to scrap and re-do a half-completed proof due to a logical hole I overlooked in the formalization. Of course, there is satisfaction and pride once the proof is done, and that provides a motivating reward. This feeling for me is deeper than the satisfaction that I get from say completing a computer program - since there can be no bugs, it is done once and for all, and I feel a sense of relief that I'll never have to worry about it again for the rest of my life.</dd></dl></dl><ul><li>Do you ponder relevant issues during your "spare" time or while doing other things?</li></ul><dl class="quote"><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Yes.</dd></dl></dl><ul><li>Is it possible to "get anything done" in less than a few hours (i.e. the work involves immersion and construction of complex mental structures in RAM)?</li></ul><dl class="quote"><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>That depends.

This is the first PDA I've ever owned or used. I put a simple Metamath browser on it, and here is a <a class="url outside" href="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/_screen-palmmm.jpg">screenshot</a>. Now I don't have to lug my laptop around everywhere. I couldn't figure out how to put a symbol font on it, so I settled for ASCII, but that is adequate for what I need. It holds all 8300 definitions and theorems in 600KB, so there is plenty of room for future expansion (the PDA has 32MB). I'm still keeping my appointments in my little red book, since I don't really trust it yet. :) --<a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 13 Oct 2006</dd></dl></dd></dl></dl><ul><li>Do you like proving "just because" you like proving (it is sufficient unto itself, requires no justification and is its own reward)?</li></ul><dl class="quote"><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>I like seeing the goal and knowing that it has been rigorously confirmed. Once it is proved, I don't care that much about the proof itself anymore (other than being proud of knowing that I did it), except that the shorter it is, the happier I am with it, to reduce the size of set.mm. I don't really expect others to plow through my proofs except either to use as examples of how to prove things, or to convince themselves when they are stuck trying to figure out at a higher level how something is derived (which, from my own experience, can often be done just by looking at a few higher-level steps until you grasp the idea).</dd></dl></dl><p>OK, Thanks for the information &#x2013; it is useful stuff that I can apply to the task of writing the user manual/tutorial for the mmj2 Proof Assistant GUI. One conundrum I faced is that the mmj2 PA GUI provides no magic bullet, regardless of the number of tricks, hints and labor-saving features; the user still has to get <b>into</b> the mindspace, and there is no substitute for knowing the subject matter (which was never the intention, but rather to allow subject matter knowledge to predominate in spite of a lack of knowledge of Metamath statement labels.) I have several ideas about how to proceed (still procrastinating). A tutorial will use Proof Worksheet files: example001.txt, example002.txt, etc., and the instructional remarks will be comment lines in the Proof Worksheets. And I am pondering the idea of providing a set of exercises using the Natural Deduction approach adapted for Metamath (Hilbert style) &#x2013; the completed proofs will then be re-verified minus the tutorial's "axioms" using just set.mm as a final educational experience! This will emphasize the necessity of <b>knowing</b>, say, propositional logic prior to proving propositional logic theorems. And I feel comfortable now in asserting that when learning a completely new subject a student is likely to experience discomfort and suffering, but that these emotions are typical, if not actually necessary!</p><p>--<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a> 24-Sep-2006 </p><hr /><p>Wanted: theorems, at least a few in peano.mm!</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>I guess no one has volunteered yet, so I'll continue your request in the "Summary" line. <a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 3-Oct-2006</dd></dl><p>I tested the mmj2 Proof Assistant with ql.mm, peano.mm and miu.mm.</p><p>The problem with miu.mm is, I believe, that the grammar is infinitely ambiguous &#x2013; and theorem1's proof will not unify successfully, as is (I need to graph the syntax trees and nail this down, but note that "info" messages are produced during startup of mmj2.bat about the grammar, and I have examined the ambiguity of miu.mm extensively in the past and am not surprised to see the unification problem in action.)</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>The MIU system, unfortunately perhaps, had a strong influence on the flexibility built into Metamath. While trying to figure out exactly what a "formal system" was, I was deceived into thinking that if it couldn't even handle the trivial MIU, how could it possibly handle "real" formal systems? My current feeling is that the substitution with empty strings that miu.mm requires is ugly and should be forbidden by the spec. The problem is that a lot of newcomers tend to be attracted to miu.mm because it's simple and, being Hofstadter-related, seems to have a certain coolness factor, and I'd hate to turn them away. So empty substitution will stay in the spec for that purpose, for the time being, but no one should use it in a new mm database.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>In later years I have felt that the real essence or spirit of what Metamath "should" be is that built into the Metamath Solitaire applet, with a much more restrictive syntax (split into separate internal RPN and external human representation) that can still do everything in set.mm, but cannot do miu.mm or many other creative variations of $a's. Off and on I have been tempted to drastically revise the Metamath spec/program/database accordingly, but in the end have felt there is still a certain convenience to having the source file somewhat human-readable, which would be lost with RPN. Now of course there is Ghilbert, so it would probably be pointless to convert to the Solitaire method.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>So, we currently have the somewhat "too flexible" original Metamath, and we have the more disciplined Ghilbert. But in a way it perhaps it  is nice to have a choice, for the time being. It can be fun to toy with crazy $a's that people invent, and usually proving them inconsistent. :) And, it appears, people enjoy writing verifiers for it. --<a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 3-Oct-2006<dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>The interesting thing for me about miu.mm is that if we remove axiom "wxy", the proof of the theorem still holds. This is the only extant example, AFAIK, of a provable Metamath theorem whose formula cannot be parsed. That topic/question was a real boggler for me back in 2004 :)</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>A possible project &#x2013; or unsolved problem &#x2013; for a Friend of Metamath is to create an unambiguous context-free grammar for miu.mm, whether or not it includes  "empty substitution".</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>mmj2 deals with "Nulls Permitted" Syntax Axioms, which provide the syntactic mechanism for enabling empty substitution. For example, "nullWFF <img class='InlineMath' src='_latex_data/2ZEGNx6VCGluNJlZVvlQlQ.png' alt='$ a wff  $'/>." is a Nulls Permitted Syntax Axiom.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>Metamath, as presently defined provides an excellent playground for both novice language designers and computer programmer/scientists -- not to mention "mathelogicians" of the Hilbertian variety (Bertrand Russell would have really liked Metamath, I am sure!)<dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Imagine how he must have felt knowing that <em>Principia Mathematica</em> could collapse like a house of cards if there was even one slip-up or "bug" in the fragile tangle of theorems it was built on, with no way to verify it with certainty and requiring arduous human checking that at most would reduce the risk. In his autobiography he wrote, "My intellect never quite recovered from the strain of writing it."</dd></dl></dd><dt /><dd>Therefore, I recommend leaving in place "empty substitution" in the Metamath spec and program, whether or not set.mm uses them. Null substitutions hold a solid position in the theory of formal languages &#x2013; see: [ <a class="url" href="http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html">http://www.cs.vu.nl/~dick/PTAPG.html</a> Dick Grune and Ceriel J.H.

I accept personal responsibility for never having invented any, but it would be great if one of Metamath's fans could write some! The interesting thing  about peano.mm right now is that it uses <b>prefix</b> notation and it would be nice to see TMFF in action with prefix syntax.</p><p>ql.mm is not a problem.

Is that correct? Is it doable?</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>That is correct. It is not doable at present, because the present MM-PA proof assistant has no concept of $d's, which have to be checked with normal proof verification. While I have a to-do list item for it, so far I haven't been motivated to put $d handling in MM-PA (particularly because it isn't a trivial retrofit the way MM-PA is written) because it hasn't been a significant problem for me (and might even be an impediment since I usually put them in "after the fact," not always knowing what they will be until the proof is done). It might be a problem for others; I'm not sure.</dd></dl><p>2) Is it true that EIMM can only import proofs for theorems that already exist in the input .mm database?</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>That's correct. You have to be inside of the MM-PA session of the theorem being imported.<dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>I think it may be time for a utility for batch import of theorems and proofs, with $d's, etc. Could be a standalone utility based on the .mmp format. Could be a java program :) Or C. Or python&#x2026;lisp&#x2026;whatever. --<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Yes, this would be nice to have. As with all such decisions (like whether to develop a full-blown IDE, etc.) I try to put things into perspective: in a practical sense, what are the time savings that the tool will buy over doing the task via a text editor, compared to the overall time spent developing a proof? Except for very simple proofs, most of the time I spend is working on the proof itself, and the time needed to place the theorem in the .mm file with a text editor is small by comparison. In the very long run, any automation will most likely pay for itself. But I am always torn between the time I have available to develop the content of set.mm and the time neeed to develop additional automation tools - typically I take the selfish approach of doing the latter when some repetitive task starts to annoy me. Hopefully, there will continue to be other people who enjoy tool development more than formalizing proofs, and I can benefit from their efforts, just as they can benefit from having the database developed further. --<a class="local" href="norm">norm</a><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Perhaps a new project can provide the additional features  the customers are demanding :) Adding new theorems and their proofs manually does not require a lot of time compared to actual creation/invention, but the limitations require explanation. The illusion is marred&#x2026; Did you know that internally mmj2 actually creates theorem, log hyp and cnst "temp" objects but does not  reuse them if the user goes on to create another proof &#x2013; that is because the .mm database is not updated and inconsistency would create its own problems. A metaphor: the tropical garden patch near the swimming pool at our house&#x2026; I spent a couple of hours pruning and cleaning it, generating half a recycling container of waste. After I was done no one noticed anything different! My work was of such high quality that I made the garden look exactly like it was supposed to look, therefore the changes were invisible to the eye of the casual observer. --<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>3) Is it possible to execute EIMM for Export and Import via a batch command file?

That works. I'll have to try the eimmimp.cmd version &#x2013; (note to self: remember to add the "save"). --<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Don't be shy about changing the .cmd's themselves, or creating your own, if it would be beneficial; they are just scripts to let metamath talk to the actual eimm program. 'eimm --help' describes the usage of the eimm program itself, which normally isn't - but could be - used on a standalone basis. Note that in a .cmd, a line in quotes is sent to the OS, although I try to avoid that since it makes the script OS-dependent. The metamath 'tools' command can do limited file manipulations to achieve some OS independence. --<a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 10-Oct-2006</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><p>4) Is it possible to modify EIMM to not produce all of those work files, and to just have it operate in memory &#x2013; this behavior clutters up the user directory. If not, can it tidy up after itself?</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>It currently needs work files, since it is outside of the metamath program and it "talks" to metamath via the metamath 'submit' command, which reads in a file, and metamath "talks" to it via logged output (show proof, etc.).</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>A possible solution would be to add it as native metamath commands, in which case intermediate files could theoretically be avoided. But I don't have time to do that right away, and anyway I want to accumulate some eimm experiences (such as the one you are reporting here) before making that big a change to the metamath program. For example, your report will provide a motivation for keeping all work internal.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>As an intermediate solution I can have it delete the temporary files when done. Also, maybe I can add a '/silent' qualifier to  'submit' to suppress  the screen output. I'll look at that.</dd><dt /><dd>.</dd><dt /><dd>The old versions of the proof worksheet are renamed to  ~1, ~2, etc. instead of deleted. I personally would prefer to keep those since such "journaled" files have allowed me to recover work countless times. They can be periodically purged with 'rm *~*' (or the equivalent in Windows). But if people feel strongly about it, maybe I  could add a '/no_journal' qualifier to 'open log' and eimm.</dd><dt /><dd>--<a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 9-Oct-2006</dd></dl><p>--<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a> 8-Oct-2006</p><h1>Yahoo Interstellar Time Capsule</h1><p><a class="url outside" href="http://www.physorg.com/news79706582.html">Yahoo set out on Monday to capture life on Earth in digital formats for a "time capsule" to be buried in Silicon Valley as well as beamed from Mexico into the cosmos.</a></p><p>I would have submitted Metamath's set.mm and ql.mm but the Yahoo page for this project required Flash software, which I abjure for security reasons.</p><p>If anything deserves to be beamed into the cosmos, it is Metamath's set.mm database, which is one of mankind's most beautiful works of epistemological glory.
