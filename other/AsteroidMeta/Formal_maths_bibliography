The bibliography and the <em>Related Work</em> work subsection in the intro may be useful for survey and literature search purposes.</dd><dt /><dd><em>Abstract.</em> In this paper we compare Mizar and Isar. A small example, Euclid's proof of the existence of infinitely many primes, is shown in both systems. We also include slightly higher-level views of formal proof sketches. Moreover a list of differences between Mizar and Isar is presented, highlighting the strengths of both systems from the perspective of end-users. Finally, we point out some key differences of the internal mechanisms of structured proof processing in either system.</dd><dt><a class="url outside" href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/comparison/diffs.pdf">Comparing mathematical provers</a> </dt><dd>by Freek Wiedijk. A nice summary of the currently available engines and projects.</dd><dt /><dd><em>Abstract.</em> We compare fiffteen systems for the formalizations of math- ematics with the computer. We present several tables that list various properties of these programs. The three main dimensions on which we compare these systems are: the size of their library, the strength of their logic and their level of automation.</dd><dt><a class="url outside" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/Research/Reports/TR143-lcp-experience.pdf">The foundation of a generic theorem prover</a> </dt><dd>by L.

It represents rules as propositions (not as functions) and builds proofs by combining rules. These operations constitute a meta-logic (or `logical framework') in which the object-logics are formalized.</dd></dl><hr /><p>I happened to stop in at Barnes and Noble yesterday and I spotted a new paperback  called "Meta Math!" by <a class="url outside" href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/CDMTCS/chaitin/">Gregory Chaitin</a>. I didn't buy it (I was already buying Minsky's new book and a paperback copy of Adams's <em>Long Dark Teatime</em> and couldn't justify the further $14 expense without checking at my local library first) but I can certainly recommend it. Chaitin uses a wide-gauge topic-filter, so, about half the book is about his thoughts about philosophy and his personal life and like that, whereas the other half is mathematics and metamathematics and Lisp and such. I figure people around here are into that sort of mixture, so I'll pass along the recommendation. --<a class="local" href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a></p></div><div class="footer"><hr /><span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="HomePage">HomePage</a> <a class="local" href="RecentChanges">RecentChanges</a> </span><span class="edit bar"><br /> <a class="edit" accesskey="e" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=Formal_maths_bibliography">Edit this page</a> <a class="history" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=history;id=Formal_maths_bibliography">View other revisions</a> <a class="admin" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=admin;id=Formal_maths_bibliography">Administration</a></span><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2006-11-16 17:54 UTC by <a class="author" title="from pa-vinh-310-af.libpub.umn.edu" href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a> <a class="diff" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=browse;diff=1;id=Formal_maths_bibliography">(diff)</a></span><form method="get" action="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
