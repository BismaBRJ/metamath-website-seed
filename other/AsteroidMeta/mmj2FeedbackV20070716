Nice! Java is a good language for this sort of project. I <b>like</b> the garbage collection, no pointers (per se), and array bounds checking. I don't like "Swing" and certainly plan to hunt for an alternative if, perhaps, I do attempt an ambitious GUI scheme involving lots of graphic rendering and novel input methods :)</p><p>--<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a> 12-Nov-2006</p><p>Perhaps now someone will figure out how to speed up the Java start-up time. On my 2GHz laptop the Metamath Solitaire applet, with 3000 lines of code, takes over 15 seconds to start up. This is compared to say the Metamath program, which has 30,000 lines of code but starts up in 6 msec on my 466MHz Linux machine, i.e. 25000 times faster in terms of (the admittedly meaningless measure of) start-up time per line of code, even disregarding CPU speed. I have no idea what the issues are, but perhaps if it were modularized so that only the components needed to run the program were loaded, and nothing else, it could be speeded up a 100 or 1000 times for small programs. Now that it's open sourced, maybe someone will be inspired to look into what can be done. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="norm">norm</a></p><h1>Traces</h1><p>May I suggest O'cat that it is very difficult to find the important information  in the traces of mmj2 (either when the software starts or when we "compile" a  proof). In the film by Forman (?) it was reproached to Mozart that there were too  many notes. I'd like to say "too many words", my dear O'cat, "too many words". &#x2013; <a class="local" href="fl">fl</a> 1-Dec-2006</p><p>You remind me of my brother Mal :)</p><p>I should really provide French output messages seeing as France is home to one-third of mmj2's customers.</p><p>In my opinion, concerning the number of words it would be worse: we, French, need such a large amount of words to succeed in saying something! Try Turkish. Turks are very concise. Normal, they are farmers, the sort of people who only pronounce two words in a day. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="fl">fl</a> 2-Dec-2006</p><p>I have pictures to show precisely what I mean but I don't know how to upload them. Any idea ? &#x2013; <a class="local" href="fl">fl</a> 3-Dec-2006</p><p>Yes. For Windows&#x2026;</p><p>The Command Window has Sysout and Syserr printstreams &#x2013; text. So, either pipe the output to a file:</p><pre>     mmj2.bat &gt; sample.txt
     </pre><p>Or, click on icon in upper-left corner of screen, then select Edit, then Mark. Then select text using mouse or cursor and hit Enter. The selected text is now in the Clipboard. Paste into document and email or post to wiki.</p><p>However, I am already clear on the concept that there ought to be a GUI to capture the output and present error messages separately from the rest of the logging/progress information.</p><p>--<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></p><p>Hum I mean to upload them onto the wiki. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="fl">fl</a></p><p>There is <i>another</i> less-travelled road, which is to segregate the mmj2 Sysout and/or Syserr messages into files using RunParms<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=RunParms">?</a>.txt:</p><pre>        *        1         2         3         4

       erase c:\my\mmjSysoutTest001.txt
     </pre><p>Using files in this way prevents you from seeing the progress through the RunParms<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=RunParms">?</a> but not does re-route error messages from Java itself. You might prefer to only re-route the Sysout messages and have the Syserr messages go straight to the screen&#x2026;</p><p>--<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></p><p>Hi Mel,</p><p>Thank you for your remarks about the way to re-route messages but what I would like is to upload some screenshots (.gif) ? Do you know a a way ? I think it's possible since there is the logo of Ghilbert somewhere. &#x2013; fl</p><p>How to upload .gif files to wiki? No clue. Upload to somewhere else and link to them? I would be cautious about filling the asteriod with gigabytes of screen shots&#x2026; --<a class="local" href="ocat">ocat</a></p><p>In my mind it could have been deleted a bit later. Never mind. Forget it. &#x2013; fl</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>In answer to Ocat's question: yes, that's how you do it. As for the stated concern, IMO if you want a page with screenshots, go ahead and build it &#x2013; since the images are linked in from somewhere else, it isn't a space concern here! --<a class="local" href="jcorneli">jcorneli</a><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Yes but I've nowhere to store them. And what I want is to store them on this server for a short time (the time to explain Ocat what are my problems with the traces of mmj2). I know I could explain with words.

For instance in a distinct variable message the two variables that need to be distinct should be in bold (or in red &#x2026; ).</p><p>3 - The number at the beginning of the message is not very interesting for the end user. It should be put at the end of the message. Instead at the beginning of the message there should be a visual anchor. For instance "[distinct variable]" in bold in E-PA-0409.</p><p>4 - Djvars or other technical mention is not easily understandable by the end user perhaps you could replace these mentions by some more obvious phrases.</p><p>Hoping it can help. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="fl">fl</a> 6-Dec-2006</p><hr /><p>A user mentioned that the "ProofAsstProofFolder<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=ProofAsstProofFolder">?</a>" was not found, and that the RunPAGUI<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=RunPAGUI">?</a>.bat command was located in such and such directory&#x2026;</p><p>The latest release of mmj2 provides a java "jar" file and a new Windows batch (command) file called "mmj2.bat".</p><p>The old "RunPAGUI<a class="edit" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=RunPAGUI">?</a>.bat" batch file is still retained in the release but it is used for volume/regression testing.</p><p>Please have a look at the "/mmj2/INSTALL.html" page contained in the mmj2.zip download. Specifically III.5.1, which offers my best suggestion for setting up mmj2 on your Windows machine. (The idea is to have mmj2 and metamath.exe located in the same directory so that eimm.exe has no problems finding Proof Worksheets to import/export):</p><pre>     Option 5.1 -- (Recommended) Use your own private directory, such as C:\mymmj2
      
     - Create directory C:\mymmj2, and 
     
     - Copy the contents of C:\mmj2\mmj2jar into C:\mymmj2, and 
     
     - Copy the following files from C:\metamath into C:\mymmj2:
          metamath.exe
          eimm.exe
          eimmexp.cmd
          eimmimp.cmd
          set.mm (and/or whatever .mm Metamath database(s) you plan to use)</pre><pre>     - Update c:\mymmj2\mmj2.bat so that the PUSHD command points to
         C:\mymmj2 instead of c: \mmj2\mmj2jar</pre><pre>     - Update c:\mymmj2\RunParms.txt so that the ProofAsstProofFolder points
        to c:\mymmj2, as follows:
       
         ProofAsstProofFolder,C:\mymmj2
