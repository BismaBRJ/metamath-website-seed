Metamath defines π as the smallest positive zero of the sine function, but as yet it has no proof that any such number exists!" (Excerpt of Jason Orendorff's blog)</p><p>Reading this, I began to think about what it does mean that something exists in set.mm. Here are the answers that come to my mind:</p><ul><li>1 - The new definition doesn't make the system unsound.</li><li>2 - If what is defined is a class it means that the class is a set. (But in fact we can  as well say that V exists and V is not a set. )</li><li>3 - If what is defined is a set it is not the empty set.</li><li>4 - It can also means π e. RR .</li></ul><p>I have perhaps forgotten some meanings.</p><p>So what would happen if the smallest positive zero of the sine function didn't exist ?</p><p>&#x2013; fl 13-Dec-2006</p><p>In ZF set theory, the "existence" of a class A simply means that A is a set, or <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/isset.html">equivalently</a> A e. V. The class V <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/nvelv.html">does not exist</a>. On the other hand, the existence of  <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/df-pi.html">pi</a> is easy to show: use <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/ltso.html">ltso</a>, <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/cnvso.html">cnvso</a>, and <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/supex.html">supex</a>. But that doesn't help us much. The problem is to show that pi is a real number. I haven't found an "easy" way to show this; perhaps a different definition of pi would be better. Any suggestions would be appreciated. Or better, actual proofs. :) BTW  if the smallest positive zero of the sine function didn't exist, then it is not hard to see from  <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/df-sup.html">df-sup</a> that pi, as it is currently defined, would simply equal the empty set. And, as a matter of curiosity only, the empty set is  <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/0ncn.html">not a complex number</a> in set.mm, although that is dependent on set.mm's particular Dedekind-cut construction and shouldn't be depended on (e.g. <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/mmset.html#Quine">Quine</a> gives a real number construction where the empty set is the number 0). &#x2013; <a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 13 Dec 2006</p><p>If you want to prove that π, as defined in set.mm, is a real number, then probably the most direct way is as follows:</p><p>1. Prove that sin is a continuous function. I'm not sure how much more infrastructure is needed to do that - certainly continuity is one of the active areas of development there.</p><p>2. Prove error bounds on truncating the power series of the sin function, analogous to <a class="url outside" href="http://us.metamath.org/mpegif/ege2le3.html">ege2le3</a>.</p><p>3. Implement a four-function calculator for rational numbers, so you can automatically compute approximate values for sin(2) and sin(4), accurate enough to prove that sin(2) &gt; 0 and sin(4) &lt; 0.</p><p>If you want to prove that 2 &lt; π &lt; 4, then what I'd recommend is developing the sinc function, and showing that sinc(x)&gt;0 for 0 &lt; x &lt; 2.</p><p>Of course, once we have more calculus in place, it should be possible to prove that the value of π is a standard power series approximation, or even a spigot function. Then it should be practical to compute many digits of precision. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="raph">raph</a></p><p>Pi fans will be happy to know that as of today, π has been shown to be <a class="url outside" href="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/mpegif/pire.html">real</a> in Metamath's set.mm database, and also that <a class="url outside" href="http://us2.metamath.org:8888/mpegif/pigt2lt4.html">2 &lt; π &lt; 4</a>, thanks to the impressive work of Paul Chapman. &#x2013; <a class="local" href="norm">norm</a> 23 Jan 2008</p><h2>Injective, surjective</h2><p>Jason's blog (continued)</p><p>"The book I'm reading (by Benjamin Pierce) offers “injective functions are monic in Set; surjective functions are epic” as a mnemonic, you know, to help you remember  monic and epic. This has to be the worst mnemonic of all time. I just don't  see anything helpful about it. Sur- means “under”. Epi- mean “on top of”. I can never remember the difference between injective and surjective  to begin with." Jason's blog"</p><dl class="quote"><dt /><dd>Neither do I. And I should: "applications injectives" and "surjectives" are the official terms in France for 1-to-1 and onto mappings ( <a class="url" href="http://spiral.univ-lyon1.fr/mathsv/cours/analyse/Chap1/c1p3D.html">http://spiral.univ-lyon1.fr/mathsv/cours/analyse/Chap1/c1p3D.html</a> ). They are (seemingly) Bourbaki's creation. However "sur" doesn't mean "under" it means "on top of". Perhaps what Pierce had in mind when he gave his "mnemonic". &#x2013; <a class="local" href="fl">fl</a> 25-Jan-2008</dd></dl></div><div class="footer"><hr /><span class="gotobar bar"><a class="local" href="HomePage">HomePage</a> <a class="local" href="RecentChanges">RecentChanges</a> </span><span class="edit bar"><br /> <a class="edit" accesskey="e" title="Click to edit this page" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=edit;id=jorend">Edit this page</a> <a class="history" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=history;id=jorend">View other revisions</a> <a class="admin" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=admin;id=jorend">Administration</a></span><span class="time"><br /> Last edited 2008-01-25 06:21 UTC by <a class="author" title="from ATuileries-151-1-64-151.w83-202.abo.wanadoo.fr" href="ocat">ocat</a> <a class="diff" href="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta?action=browse;diff=1;id=jorend">(diff)</a></span><form method="get" action="http://planetx.cc.vt.edu/AsteroidMeta" enctype="application/x-www-form-urlencoded">
