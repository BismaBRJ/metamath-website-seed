<P><A NAME="problem"></A><B>The problem</B>

<P> I received my Czur scanner about 2 weeks ago.  After several
evenings of frustration with poor results trying to scan books, I was
about to give up and go back to my reliable but painfully slow flatbed
scanner.  Maybe I have been spoiled by the professional-level high
quality of flatbed scanners, but I wanted to achieve the same results
with the Czur scanner.

<P>The hardware of the Czur scanner is quite nice.  But I have concluded
that the software just isn't ready for prime time.  I could see it
taking 6 months to a year or more to be perfected, and I don't want to
wait that long.

<P>The Books mode tries to flatten the text on curved pages by pointing
a laser beam at an angle to obtain a curved line corresponding to the
page curve.  But unless the book is opened in a very particular way, you
can end up with somewhat wavy lines of text, which is readable but not
very pleasant or professional-looking.  Also, getting it to recognize
the edges of the book, especially with your hands holding it open, is
tenuous and sometimes requires multiple attempts per page (making it
slower than a flatbed scanner once you add up all time spent carefully
examining each page to delete and rescan the bad ones and doing manual
renames to get everything back into sorted order again).  Even when
everything works more or less as intended, flattened text near the
steeply sloped middle of facing pages can be slightly blurry because of
the severe transformation that it undergoes, which may be a problem
if the font is very small.

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<P><A NAME="solution"></A><B>A solution</B>

<P>Fortunately, I have come up with at method that is quite satisfactory
for people like me who are used to flatbed scanners and have their own
workflow set up to process the images, i.e. to perform the steps of
trimming pages, converting to black and white, and doing OCR.  I use
(the very old) Photoshop 7 for the image processing.  There are also
free open-source alternatives such as GIMP that will work.

<P>What I'm about to describe is how to trick the Czur into emulating a
"dumb" flatbed scanner, but with much faster scans than a typical
flatbed scanner.  This method is intended for black-and-white text.
For images requiring color, it will work, but the colors may not be
uniform depending on the lighting.

<P><B>Warning!</B> A physical drawback of this method is the same as
with a flatbed scanner, which is that the book has to be pressed flat to
obtain a good result.  This will stress or break the binding on some books
and certainly  doesn't leave the book in a pristine
"like new" condition.  It is best used on books you intend to discard
after scanning or don't mind if they may be damaged.

<P>Because I already have a process set up for my flatbed scanner,
basically all I need from the scanner is just an unprocessed, plain
image without "rectifying", "beautifying", "purifying", or any of the
other "smart" processing options applied.  It appears that
none of this can be turned off in the software.  I would recommend to
Czur that future software have a configuration menu that allows features
to turned off and on selectively (and maybe also explain in the
manual what they mean).

<P>However, I discovered a trick.  In Books mode (but not in Single
mode), if you cover up the lasers with a piece of duck tape, it seems
that it will revert to a "dumb" mode that simply produces the full 4608 x
3456 camera image with little or no processing.


<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<P><A NAME="parts"></A><B>Parts list</B>

<P>You will need the following items to perform what I will describe:

<OL>
<LI>A piece of plexiglass to cover the book to press the pages flat.  I
bought a 10-inch by 14-inch piece at a hardware store for about $12,
which included cutting it to size.  A larger piece will be needed for
larger books.

<LI>External lighting.    I used 2 desk lamps, one on each side of black mat.

<LI>A piece of duck tape or other method to cover the scanner's lasers.

<LI>Some stickers to mark where the book
should be positioned (see Fig. 1-(2) below).

<LI>A couple of crumpled up tissues or napkins, or a soft piece of foam
rubber to place under the book (see Fig. 1-(5) below).
</OL>


<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<P><A NAME="scan"></A><B>Instructions for scanning</B>


<P>I have attached 3 images showing the overall process, which I will
describe.

<P>To get into the correct mode on the Czur scanner, perform the following steps.

<UL>
<LI>Launch Czur scanner
<LI>Click Scanner
<LI>Click Scan
<LI>In the Preview pane, select Books, then Confirm
</UL>

<P>Make sure the laser is covered up.  Turn the LED lighting off with the
silver button on the bottom of the scanner.  You need external lighting
instead.

<P>Fig. 1 is a 4608 x 3456 image I captured this way.  I have marked it up
with annotations to explain what I
did.

</TABLE>

<P>Fig. 1-(1):  You can see the edges of the plexiglass sheet placed
over the book.  If the book is small like this one, it is easiest to
scan it sideways like this.

<P>Fig. 1-(2):  I placed stickers marking where the book should be
positioned.  It is important to get the positioning consistent since
that will allow automated batch trimming later based on absolute image
coordinates.

<P>Fig. 1-(3):  Press down in or near the middle of the facing pages so
the pages end up flush against the plexiglass.  Pay particular attention
to the center of the book, which may require some pressure to get as
flat as possible.  You may have to fold the book back a little to get
the binding to open better.

<P><B>Warning:</B> This may damage the book's binding!  To reduce
possible damage, follow the rules you may have learned in grade school
for breaking in a new textbook.  This consists of opening several pages
partially throughout the book, then repeating the process to open them
more and more, so the spine follows a gentle rounded curve rather than
having a sudden severe, ugly bend at one spot.  If the book is very old
with hardened, brittle glue holding it together, accept the fact that
you will probably break the binding and will need to repair or discard
it.  Do not scan with this method if that is not acceptable!

<P>For a larger book that must be positioned left to right, it might
be easier to work from the side of the scanner to prevent your arms
from blocking the image.  I don't have experience with a large book
yet.

<P>Fig. 1-(4):  The LEDs must be turned off, and the external lamps must
be positioned so they don't reflect off of the plexiglass.  Here you can
see the left lamp's partial reflection, but as long as it is not over
the book it is fine.  Try to get the illumination as uniform as
you can, although it's not necessary for it to be perfect.

<P>Fig. 1-(5):  When scanning the first and last few pages of the book,
one side will be thinner (have fewer pages) than the other, making it
hard to press flat.  I solved this by placing a couple of crumpled tisses
(or soft foam) under the front cover to help push the thin side against
the plexiglass.

<P>Fig. 1-(6): To make sure that you have the right mode enabled as above, check
that the image size is exactly 4608 by 3456 pixels.  If it is different,
either the lasers weren't blocked or you selected single page mode
instead of book mode.

<P>Fig. 1-(7):  I've circled a portion of the smaller text on the page
that appears in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3.

<P>Fig. 2 shows a blowup of this circled portion.

<P><A NAME="post"></A><B>Suggestions for post-processing</B>

<P>Here I will give an overview of how I post-processed the image to
achieve the bitmap of Fig. 3. Your process may vary depending on your
software.  Of course you want to exploit any batch processing features
of your software such as scripting (called "actions" in Photoshop) in
order to achieve the most efficient workflow.  I won't get into those
details here.

<P>After scanning your pages, the Czur images will be stored under
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Czur scanner\sources\2016_mm_dd_hh_mm_ss\"
(where mm is the month, etc.) as files image0001.jpg, image0002.jpg,
etc.  This directory requires administrator privileges, so to work with
the files you may need to copy this folder to a folder under your C:\User
account.

<P>To achieve the result of Fig. 3, I performed the following
processing steps starting from Fig. 2 (the original scan).

<P>1.  For some reason the Czur image resolution is set to 72 ppi.  I
measured the actual scanner resolution to be about 250 ppi (it varies with
vertical distance i.e. thickness book; see below).  So first I
corrected this (without resampling the image).  In Photoshop 7 this is
done by selecting Image -> Image Size and changing the Resolution from
72 to 250 ppi with resampling turned off.

<P>2.  Because of the uneven illumination of the page, threshold
detection at this point won't work well directly.  I passed the image
through Photoshop's high pass filter, under Filter -> Other -> High Pass
with Radius set to 60 pixels.  Basically you want to get the background
to be more or less uniform.

<P>3.  To obtain a good bitmap that isn't too jagged, we need to
increase the resolution.  I did this by selecting Image -> Image Size
and changing the Resolution from 250 ppi to 600 ppi with bicubic
resampling.  Actually, 300 ppi is probably adequate for most books
without small fonts, and it will result in a smaller final PDF.
(Update, June 5, 2016: I have been resampling to 400 ppi for
the several most recent books I scanned, and it seems to be a
good compromise.)

<P>4.  Now it is a matter of converting to black and white.  The method
for Photoshop is described in the next section, and the result
is Fig. 3.

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<P><A NAME="ps7"></A><B>Some details for Photoshop 7</B>

<P>(Added June 5, 2016)

<P>I was asked about the process I used with Photoshop.  I never
upgraded from PS7 since it does what I need.  The commands in other
versions of PS or alternatives may be different, but my experience may
serve as a guide.

<P>You can find Photoshop 7 tutorials online, and I will assume you know
how to create Actions (scripts) for trimming the image and extracting
the left and right of facing pages.  Always save the JPG with the
highest quality at intermediate steps.  Tip:  when running the Action
(via File -> Automate -> Batch) to extract the right-hand page, under
File Naming use Document Name + extension + extension.  If the left-hand
page is named image0055.jpg, then the right-hand page will be named
image0055jpg.jpg and thus will sort immediately after the left-hand page
for later page assembly with a PDF creator.

<P>I will assume you've succeeded in making a directory with
the  JPG images of the left and right book pages.

<P>The critical step is converting color to bitmap, and I'll give the
exact steps I used.  After a number of experiments, I've determined that
resampling to 400 ppi seems to be a good compromise between file size
and bitmap quality.  I created an Action (script) that recorded the
following steps:

<OL>
<LI> File -> Open -> select a JPG file with a book page -> Open
<LI> Image -> Image size -> change 72 to 250 with Resample image unchecked -> OK
<LI> Image -> Image size -> change 250 to 400 with Resample image set to
 Bicubic -> OK
<LI> Filter -> Other -> High pass -> set Radius to 60 pixels -> OK
<LI> Image -> Mode -> Grayscale -> Discard color information? -> OK
<LI> Image -> Adjustments -> Curves -> horizontally drag bottom of curve
 to Input 65%,
 horizontally drag top of curve to Input 67% -> OK
<LI> Image -> Mode -> Bitmap -> Output 400 pixels/inch, Use 50% Threshold -> OK
<LI> File -> Save As -> select PNG extension -> Save -> PNG Options None -> OK
</OL>

<P>The settings in these steps work well over a wide range of page
illumination and is relatively insensitive to non-uniformities in the
illumination.

<P>This procedure is intended to convert text to black and white letters
for both smaller file size and for better OCR performance.  Photos and
other images with color and gray will be damaged by this conversion, and
you need to separate out such pages.

<P><A NAME="quality"></A><B>Czur scanner quality vs. flatbed scanner quality</B>

<P>(Added June 3, 2016)

<P>For most of my past scans I've used a flatbed scanner at 300 ppi,
which has been more than enough for essentially all books and documents
that I've ever scanned.  Some perfectionists use 600 ppi to obtain a
professional, publication-quality scan, but for home use
that is overkill, and I don't like the greater file size.  Even the
tiniest math subscripts have been clearly legible at 300 ppi.

<P>I made a full-color scan of the page above at 300 ppi on an Epson
NX420.  Fig. 4 shows a side-by-side view of the Czur and
the Epson, greatly magnified so they can be compared at the pixel level.
The Czur scan is smaller since its resolution is about 250 ppi.  (The
flatbed scan is slightly tilted but should give the idea. I didn't feel like
doing it over again.)

<P>In Fig. 5, I did a bicubic resampling of the Czur to 300 ppi for an
easier comparison.

</TABLE>

<P>The Czur isn't as crisp as the Epson, so this is a tradeoff that you
should be aware of.  I think the Czur will be fine for most books.  For
a math text with tiny subscripts, you probably want to check the
legibility with the Czur and perhaps revert to a flatbed scanner for
problematic pages.


<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<P><A NAME="pixels"></A><B>Resolution of the scanned image</B>

<P>(Added June 4, 2016)

<P>I measured the pixels per inch by scanning a ruler, and it varies
with vertical distance (z-direction), i.e. thickness of the book, as one
would expect.  It was 242.8 ppi with the ruler placed directly on top of
the black mat, 253.9 ppi on top of a book with 0.62-inch thickness, and
266.0 ppi on top of a book with 1.20-inch thickness.  Thus starting from
242.8 ppi at the mat, the resolution increases an average of about 18.8
ppi for every vertical (z-direction) inch.  I am now using 250 ppi
as a typical value for post-processing software.

<P>Note that this is <I>not</I> the actual resolution of the scanner,
since the camera does not focus down the the pixel level (see Fig. 4
above).  Someone else who is knowledgeable about these things may want
to measure the true resolution, for example with a test sheet of lines that
get closer and closer together until they can no longer be distinguished.

<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>


<P><A NAME="further"></A><B>Further comments and suggestions</B>

<P>(Added June 4, 2016)

<P>1.  In Fig. 1 above, notice that there is a vertical smear on tip of
my right thumb.  At first I thought I had moved my thumb during the
scan, but actually it is an artifact of the scanner, because I have seen
similar vertical smears at other times even when my hands are nowhere
near the scanner.  Thankfully it hasn't happened on top of the book page
and is usually on the dark side of an edge, but it may be a problem when
scanning pages with photographs.  It seems that the "dumb" scan mode I'm
trying to trick the scanner into is doing some kind of unwanted
processing anyway, Again, I wish Czur would provide a feature to turn
off ALL image processing and just let us use the hardware!

<P>2. After scanning and post-processing several books, here are some
things I found helpful.
<UL>
<LI>If the plexiglass isn't parallel to the mat but at a slight
angle (for example when scanning near the beginning or end of the book),
the text can have a noticeable distortion (text lines closer together
at one end of the page) due to the variation in the
ppi in the z-direction.  So I now I try to make sure that the plexiglass
is reasonably parallel by stuffing the necessary amount of
tissues under the thinner side.  In the future I may try thin sheets
of soft foam rubber where I remove them as scanning progresses then add them
to the other side when I'm past the middle page.
</LI>

<LI>In Fig. 1-(2), I show alignment stickers only on the bottom of the
figure.  I get better post-processing results with alignment
stickers at all four
corners.
</LI>

<LI>Because of the slight blurriness of the image at the pixel level, I
found I get slightly improved final bitmaps if I do bicubic resampling
at 600 ppi rather than 300 ppi, before converting to bitmap.  It seems
this provides a cleaner threshold (Fig. 3 above).  The final bitmap file
size is about 2 times larger, so I probably would still use 300 ppi
resampling for a book that has no footnote-size text.  (With my flatbed
scanner, I always leave it at 300 ppi without resampling since the
flatbed scanner is precise down to the single pixel level.)  </LI> </UL>

</TABLE>


<P>In the scan of this book cover, the word "LIFE" in the book's title
has a missing "L" and a smeared "I"!  I had hoped that I had disabled
all "smart" processing by covering the laser in Books mode to achieve
the full 4608 x 3456 camera image, but I assumed wrong.  This happens
intermittently, and the algorithm it uses is bizarre and unreliable.
Maybe it thought the "L" in the title was a fingertip and deleted it?

<P>I discovered this long after I thought my scan was finished.
Fortunately I still had the book and was able to make another scan
without this artifact, which sometimes happens and sometimes doesn't.

<P>This is <I>unacceptable.</I> It means that I have to carefully
inspect every scan for such surprises, greatly slowing down the scanning
process.  Because the software cleverly restores the background color,
it can sometimes be subtle and hard to detect except by careful
comparison to the original.  Even in this case, if it weren't for the
misspelling, one might think it was just an artistic effect to convey
fast-paced corporate life. :)

<P>A lot of us have used flatbed scanners for many years and have our
own post-processing methods that we are happy with.  All we need is
a method for getting the images into the computer.  The big advantage
of Czur for us is the high speed of the hardware, and that alone is
worth the money I paid.  But if we can't get the images into
the computer in a reliable way, the high speed is worthless.

<P>We desperately need a checkbox or third option to "Single"/"Books"
called "Unprocessed" or "Raw" on the Czur software that turns off
<B>all</B> "smart" processing and provides us with the 4608 x 3456
<B>unprocessed</B> image that you see on the computer screen.  (If Czur
is reading this, by "Raw" I don't mean the photographic RAW file of the
camera but just the image like in Fig. 6 above without any smart
processing artifacts like the missing L. "Unprocessed" might be a better
name.)  I think this would be relatively simple for Czur to do, since it
is just just disabling or bypassing those processing steps in their
software.  That would make me and I think a lot of other users much
happier.

<!--
<P>A TWAIN driver allowing us to feed an <B>unprocessed</B> image
directly into Photoshop or equivalent would also be welcome.  TWAIN is
the industry standard protocol that is used by virtually every other
scanner in the world, except Czur.
-->


<HR NOSHADE SIZE=1>

<P><A NAME="conclusion"></A><B>Conclusion</B>

<P>The image produced by the Czur scanner is about 250 ppi.  The actual
resolution may be somewhat less since the camera focusing is not perfect
down to the pixel level.  But as the samples above show, it should be
more than adequate for a typical book.

<P>The big advantage for home use is that it is MUCH faster than a
typical home-use flatbed scanner.  While the resolution tradeoff is one
thing to consider, the higher speed is a very attractive feature that
makes it worthwhile.  In my case, I think that I will be using the Czur
to scan all but the most demanding books.

<P>Heiko Rath writes (2-Jun-2016):

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Thank you for sharing your scanning process.  One thing I noticed
while trying to work around limitations of the Czur scanner software is
that new/unmodified images are initially stored in the following folder:

<P>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; C:\Users\&lt;user name&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\sources

<P>and deleted when you close the program/switch to another folder.

<P>As you mentioned post-processing capabilities in the application are
pretty limited.  I've gotten better results when I copy the source scans
from C:\Users\&lt;User&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\sources and then perform
post-processing with Scan Tailor to rotate/split pages/select
content/remove extraneous borders/normalize exposure &amp; resize all pages
to exact same size.  Then I've used IrfanView to rename all files as
image00xxx and run the embedded Abbyy FineReader OCR over it to turn
things into a PDF with searchable text.  This generates pretty good
output, but there is one thing that slightly bothers me.  Abbyy
FineReader apparently analyzes the images and decides to also slightly
rotate/resize resulting in some pages that are just a little
tilted/different sizes.  If there were an option to tell Abbyy
Finereader not to rotate/resize it should be made user selectable.  I am
starting to experiment with Tesseract on a Linux box to see if I can get
improved results.
